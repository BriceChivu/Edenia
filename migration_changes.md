# Edenia Migration Changes

This append-only ledger records every conceptual change made during the conservative
architecture and responsive migration. Each migration commit must add an entry whose
`MIG-###` identifier matches the commit subject.

Existing entries must not be silently rewritten or removed. Corrections, reversals,
release mappings, and follow-up findings are recorded as new entries.

## Entry format

- **ID:** `MIG-###`
- **Date:** `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Phase:** Migration phase
- **Type:** Governance, tooling, tests, structure, compatibility, responsive, visual,
  documentation, release, or rollback
- **Status:** Implemented, verified, released, superseded, or rolled back
- **Intent:** Why the change exists
- **Conceptual change:** What changed, independent of individual code lines
- **Preservation contract:** What must remain unchanged
- **Risks:** Affected behavior and likely failure modes
- **Verification:** Checks performed and their result
- **Rollback:** How to reverse the change safely
- **Association:** Branch, pull request, commit, and release when available

## MIG-001 — Establish migration governance and stable baseline

- **Date:** 2026-07-28
- **Phase:** 1 — Stable baseline and safety harness
- **Type:** Governance and release
- **Status:** Implemented locally; remote publication pending GitHub authentication
- **Intent:** Give every migration change an auditable history and create an exact
  rollback point before application files are reorganized.
- **Conceptual change:** Declared the current `master` commit
  `0c3f98fb865acc7695c85579d90d730ceead607a` as the protected pre-migration
  baseline, created the annotated local tag `v1.0.0`, opened the sequential phase
  branch `codex/migration-01-safety-harness`, added this append-only ledger, and
  added a migration-focused pull-request checklist.
- **Preservation contract:** No application source, runtime behavior, deployed
  output, storage, analytics, localization, responsive behavior, or appearance is
  changed by this entry. Every current desktop, tablet, and phone surface remains
  **Keep** unless a later approved migration entry explicitly says otherwise.
- **Risks:** The baseline tag and branch are local until GitHub authentication is
  restored. Repository branch protection cannot yet be configured remotely.
- **Verification:** Confirmed the worktree was clean on `master`, confirmed the
  baseline commit identifier, confirmed no prior `v1.0.0` tag existed, and created
  the local tag and phase branch from that exact commit.
- **Rollback:** Before publication, delete the local phase branch and local tag.
  After publication, preserve the tag and revert migration merge commits through
  reviewed pull requests rather than rewriting history.
- **Association:** `codex/migration-01-safety-harness`; PR and GitHub Release pending.

## MIG-002 — Add a reproducible static-site build

- **Date:** 2026-07-28
- **Phase:** 1 — Stable baseline and safety harness
- **Type:** Tooling, deployment, and documentation
- **Status:** Implemented and locally build-verified; pinned CI verification pending
- **Intent:** Replace ad hoc deployment commands with one pinned, reproducible build
  used locally, in CI, and by GitHub Pages.
- **Conceptual change:** Added an npm project, pinned esbuild alongside the existing
  JavaScript minifier, pinned the supported Node 24 LTS runtime, created a
  static-site build that emits `_site`, generates commit-derived asset cache
  versions, produces an empty local/test runtime config, requires the existing
  YouTube secret for production builds, and updated all Node-based workflows and
  local-build documentation to use the supported runtime.
- **Preservation contract:** The browser continues to load the same relative
  `index.html`, `config.local.js`, `analytics.js`, `app.js`, and `style.css`
  contracts. Classic-script globals and load order remain intact, the existing
  Terser JavaScript transformation remains in use, production runtime configuration
  keeps the same `window.EDENIA_CONFIG.youtubeApiKey` shape, and no application
  behavior or appearance is intentionally changed.
- **Risks:** CSS minification moves from clean-css to esbuild because the existing
  clean-css CLI dependency introduced four high-severity dependency vulnerabilities.
  Visual regression coverage must prove equivalent rendering. Incorrect copy rules
  could omit a deployment asset. Cache-version replacement must match each entry
  asset exactly once. Node 20 from the original plan reached end of life on
  2026-03-24, so the implementation deliberately uses supported Node 24 LTS.
- **Verification:** Installed the exact lockfile dependencies with zero known audit
  vulnerabilities; built `_site`; confirmed the three entry assets receive the
  commit-derived version; confirmed runtime config syntax and an empty test key;
  confirmed tracked catalogs and `analytics.js` are copied unchanged; confirmed
  representative inline-handler globals survive minification; and confirmed ignored
  `.DS_Store` files are excluded. The local host is Node 24.10.0; CI confirmation on
  the pinned Node 24.18.0 and browser/visual coverage follow in MIG-003.
- **Rollback:** Revert this commit to restore the previous direct-copy deployment
  commands. No browser data migration is involved.
- **Association:** `codex/migration-01-safety-harness`; PR and release pending.
